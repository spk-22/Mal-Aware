[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model for classifying software as either benign or malicious based on its system process behavior. By analyzing various features derived from running processes, the model aims to provide an effective method for identifying malware.

## Project Goals

* Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying malware.
* Explore and analyze key system process features relevant to malware detection.
* Provide a clear and reproducible workflow for training and evaluating the model.
* (Optional: Investigate the interpretability of the model's predictions.)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about system processes, with features such as process counts, memory usage, loaded libraries (DLLs), handles, and more. The dataset is labeled to indicate whether a process or system state is benign or associated with malware.

**(If you can/want to mention the source of the Kaggle dataset, do so here, e.g.: "The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle Dataset Name/Link].")**

## Methodology

The project typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the system process dataset and understanding its structure and features.
2.  **Feature Preprocessing:** Cleaning, scaling, and potentially transforming the features to prepare them for the machine learning model.
3.  **Model Selection:** Choosing an appropriate machine learning model for classification (e.g., Neural Network, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
4.  **Model Training:** Training the selected model on the preprocessed data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, AUC-ROC).
6.  (Optional: Model Interpretation): Understanding which features are most important for the model's predictions.

## Code Structure

*(Provide a brief overview of the files in your repository, e.g.,)*

* `malware_classification.ipynb` (or `.py`): Contains the main code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `data/`: (Optional) Directory to store the dataset (ensure you don't commit large datasets directly).
* `models/`: (Optional) Directory to save trained model files.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `requirements.txt`: (Optional) Lists the Python libraries required to run the code.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* (Potentially other libraries depending on your model choice, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost)
